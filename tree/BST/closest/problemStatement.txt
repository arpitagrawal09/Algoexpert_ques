Given a Binary Search Tree and a target integer, we are asked to write a function that is going to return the value in the BST that is closest to the target. We can assume there is only one closest value.

For example,

      10
    /    \
   4      20
 /   \
1     6

target = 5
The closest value to the target is 4.
