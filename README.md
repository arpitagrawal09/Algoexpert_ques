# Algoexpert_ques
Description: This is a collection of many of the question from AlgoExpert Coding. It contains my work on these. Many of these solutions have been accepted, but not all. I have not only maintained the solutinos but most of my practice work too. Since AlgoExpert is a paid platform, everyone doesn't have access to all the questions. 

1. Contains the problem statement or the links to the problems. The problem statements at Algoexpert are also copyrighted. So I have tried my best to manage in any case. At many a placed I have given a test file to give the problem statement. There are also screenshots of those questions. Alternatively I have added the link to similar questions on public websites like leetcode. 
2. Test Cases : They are also at Algoexpert website. I have not copied those tests with myself.
