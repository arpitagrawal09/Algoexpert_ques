Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List that contains a loop (in other words, the list's tail node points to some node in the list instead of the None (null) value). The function should return the node (the actual node - not just its value) from which the loop originates in constant space. Note that every node in the Singly Linked List has a "value" property storing its value as well as a "next" property pointing to the next node in the list.

Sample input: n0 -> n1 -> n2 -> n3 -> n4 -> n5 -> n6 ^ v n9 <- n8 <- n7 Sample output: n4
