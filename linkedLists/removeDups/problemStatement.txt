Remove Duplicates From Linked List
Understanding the problem
We are given the head of a singly linked list. The nodes of the linked list are going to be sorted in ascending order with respect to their values and the values are going to be integers. We are asked to write a function that is going to remove all the nodes with duplicate values and return the modified linked list. The linked list should be modified in place and the nodes should remain in their original order.
