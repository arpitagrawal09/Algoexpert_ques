Product Sum


Understanding the problem
We are given a "special" array, which contains integers and optionally other "special" arrays. We are asked to write a function that is going to return the sum of the elements in the "special" array. If the element is a "special" array, we need to sum up the elements in the "special" array and then multiply the sum by the depth of the "special" array. For instance, if the input array is [3, [4, 5]], then the result should be 3 + 2 * (4 + 5) = 21; if the input array is [6, [4, [5]]], then the result should be 6 + 2 * (4 + 3 * 5) = 44.
