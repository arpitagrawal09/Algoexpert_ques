You're given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves all instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array and returns the array. The function should perform this IN-PLACE and doesn't need to maintain the order of the other integers.

For example:

array = [2,1,2,2,2,3,4,2]
toMove = 2

Expected = [1,3,4,2,2,2,2,2] 
           (the numbers 1,3,4 could be ordered differently)
